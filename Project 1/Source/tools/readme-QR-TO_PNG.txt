run qr-to-png from the command line passing it an argument of your rcsid (email), 
including the @rpi.edu in quotes, like this :

qr-to-png "smithj123@rpi.edu"

If you want to launch it from windows, you can create a shortcut and add an argument to the "Target".

It will create a file with the png extension.

Rename that to qrcode.png and use it as a texture to uniquely identify
any screenshots of your homework asssignments.  

Depending on the homework, you may need to generate a new png, stay tuned!
