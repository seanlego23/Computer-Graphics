#Project Description
This project was for a Graphics for Games class at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute I took in Fall 2021.
I implemented many basic graphics algorithms including HDR and deffered shading.

#Disclaimer
Around 95% of the code is mine. The other 5% is from the minimal version of the professor's 
"sandbox" of which this is built on top of.
